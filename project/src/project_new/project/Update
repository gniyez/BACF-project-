Encapsulation: StudentUI, companyUi and careerUI mix user interaction 
with business logic 
move actions like applying for internships, editing opportunities or filtering in Application controller and internship controller 

Use interfaces and abstract classes for shared operations among various users 


Error handling and input validation:
user menu selection, internship editing, across UI classes, input validation is minimal 
nll or empty fields in registation or internship creation are less protected 
add more try catch blocks and ensure all user input is validated 

in CSV loader, parsing errors for file loading are loged but there's no attempt to skip or recover from problematic lines 
consider continuing loading whil ereporting errors, so entire files aren't lost due to one line 



data consistency:
- changes to internships e.g. creation, editing, slot management do not update related applications or system state consistently. ensure all side effects are handled e.g. updating slot counts after withdrawal, accpetance etc.
- guarantee that unique constraints e.g. max applications, company rep registration are enforced on the controller level, not just UI 

Extensibility 
- implement enum types for repeated constants e.g. statuses. levels, not free form strings to reduce typos
- use a base class / utilitty mtd for filtering logic 

documentation 
- add javadoc comments for all public classes and methods 


added enum classes internship level and status

//to add java documentation!
